					<h1>Founder&apos;s Story</h1>
					<div>
						<p>In 2015, I volunteered for an organization that helped children with Autism build a strong bond with their siblings. I met a young girl with Autism named Jessica; although she was nonverbal, her large smile could not hold back her joyful personality. Jessica was a child who never interacted with her younger brother in a socially impactful way, although there was always curiosity in her eyes when she would look at him. Working with Jessica, I helped unlock her ability to share her joyful personality with her brother. Nothing was more rewarding than witnessing Jessica and her brother play tag in the playground. There was an abundance of joy emanating from Jessica&apos;s face while being chased by her brother. That moment inspired my decision to launch Autism Aims, where we believe results are possible, and we center our programs and guiding principles with that in mind.</p>
