					<h1>Why Choose Us!</h1>
					<div>
						<p>Autism Aims uses programs that have been proven in studies from the Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis (JABA) to be effective.
						Data is collected to track the child’s behaviors and skill levels to determine the course of treatment.
						There is an individualized curriculum. As an ABA agency, we do not believe in having a cookie-cutter approach to all 2-year-olds or all 6-year-olds, regardless of what the child’s individual needs are.</p>
						<p>Autism Aims primarily focus on reinforcement techniques.
						Punishment procedures are rarely used, even in the instance of aggression. We will always try a proactive approach.
						We believe that it is essential not just to decrease the instances of the target behavior but to reinforce an appropriate replacement behavior suitable to its function.</p>
